# Uber-Trips-Analysis
Ridesharing has undeniably been a blessing for a traffic-congested city like Dhaka. However, I found myself pondering over my personal experiences with it. Was it a luxury that I indulged in occasionally, or did I rely on it for all of my transportation needs? To gain insights into my ridesharing history, I decided to request my data from Uber. They promptly provided me with comma-separated values (.csv)file containing all of my ride data associated with my email ID. With the data, I have made some obvious changes such as converting the timestamps to timestamp data format. Removal of duplicates etc. I used DBeaver database management first to make these changes, then I did a thorough Analysis with pandas (Python), seaborn, and Plotly. Read the .pdf file first to see how I prepared the data with SQL. Then take a look at the Jupyter notebook to see the EDA.
